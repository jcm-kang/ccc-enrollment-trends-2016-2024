# CA Community Colleges (CCC) Enrollment Trend Analysis 2016–2024

## Overview  
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines enrollment trends across California Community Colleges (CCC) from 2016 to 2024 using publicly available data from the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) [Data Mart](https://datamart.cccco.edu/datamart.aspx).  

The analysis examines how total enrollment changed before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic while tracking shifts across student demographics such as age, gender, and ethnicity. It also looks at enrollment type differences—full-time versus part-time students—to understand how learning preferences and participation patterns evolved over time.

Through visualizations and year-over-year comparisons, this project highlights recovery trends, demographic shifts, and possible implications for statewide access to higher education. The goal is to provide clear insights that can inform strategies around student engagement, retention, and targeted access across California’s community college system.

### Objectives  
- Observe enrollment trends over eight academic years to identify overall growth or decline  
- Assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on statewide enrollment and recovery patterns  
- Compare demographic changes by age, gender, and ethnicity  
- Explore differences in enrollment types (full-time vs. part-time)  
- Provide insights that can inform strategies to improve access, engagement, and retention

## Project Background  
The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) [Data Mart](https://datamart.cccco.edu/datamart.aspx) provides detailed statewide data on students, faculty, staff, and institutional outcomes. The dataset includes information on student demographics, enrollment status, academic programs, and course participation across all 116 community colleges.  

This project draws on Data Mart’s term-level enrollment data to analyze academic years 2016–2017 through 2023–2024. The dataset enables a detailed look at enrollment patterns over time and how statewide recovery efforts, policy changes, and shifting student needs have shaped access to higher education in California.
